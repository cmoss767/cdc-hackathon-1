Repo for the 2023 cdc hackathon

### Install/Setup Project

1. Prerequisites include git, terminal, node, and a code editor such as VSCODE

2. Open terminal and run

```sh
npm install -g yarn
npm install -g expo-cli
```

3. Install MySQL community server and MySQL Workbench app

4. In MySQL Workbench app, create a connection to localhost (the default settings when you create a new connection in Workbench will connect to localhost.) Name this connection whatever you like. If you already have a connection to localhost and have schemas in your local DB, those schemas will not interfere with our setup.

5. Clone the project from GIT

6. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:

```sh
  yarn install
```

7. Have fun and be yourself :)
